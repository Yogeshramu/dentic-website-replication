### **🔹 Notes:**
- If your image is not showing on GitHub, ensure that you **commit and push the `images` folder** along with your code:
  ```sh
  git add images/screenshots/1.png
  git commit -m "Added project screenshot"
  git push origin main
  ```
- If the image still doesn't appear, check the GitHub **case sensitivity** (e.g., `Screenshots` ≠ `screenshots`).
